**Branch**:A timeline you are currently working on in a repository, for example a feature of a project.

**Clone**: A clone is a copy of a repository or the action of copying a repository. When cloning a repository into another branch, the new branch becomes a remote-tracking branch that can talk upstream to its origin branch (via pushes, pulls, and fetches).

**Commit**: Moving changes from local to remote with a reletive message, creates a pull request on github, that allows you to push changes.

**Fetch**:By performing a Git fetch, you are downloading and copying that branch’s files to your workstation. Multiple branches can be fetched at once, and you can rename the branches when running the command to suit your needs.

**GIT**: The command line linked to github, in most cases you have to manualy commit and push changes via command line

**Github**: The online platform that restores your repositories and branch, a verison control software that allows to view all timeline/branches and changes.

**Merge**:Taking the changes from one branch and adding them into another (traditionally master) branch. These commits are usually first requested via pull request before being merged by a project maintainer.

**Merge Conflict**: A conflict between branches, usually happens when difference of code in commits, github allows to confimr merge conflict manaully by view conflicts and fixing them.

**Push**: Updates a remote branch with the commits made to the current branch. You are literally “pushing” your changes onto the remote.

**Pull**: If someone has changed code on a separate branch of a project and wants it to be reviewed to add to the master branch, that someone can put in a pull request. Pull requests ask the repo maintainers to review the commits made, and then, if acceptable, merge the changes upstream. A pull happens when adding the changes to the master branch.

**Remote**: If someone has changed code on a separate branch of a project and wants it to be reviewed to add to the master branch, that someone can put in a pull request. Pull requests ask the repo maintainers to review the commits made, and then, if acceptable, merge the changes upstream. A pull happens when adding the changes to the master branch.

**Repository**: In many ways, you can think of a Git repository as a directory that stores all the files, folders, and content needed for your project. What it actually is, is the object database of the project, storing everything from the files themselves, to the versions of those files, commits, deletions, et cetera. Repositories are not limited by user, and can be shared and copied (see: fork).
